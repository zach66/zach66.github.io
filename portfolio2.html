					<h3>Heatmap</h3>
					<p>We applied K-Means clustering across 25,000 time steps for each “Donut” (rho band) using all 2166 degrees as features. In order to perform k-means clustering on this data we decided to first reduce the dimensions by performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the scaled features for each rho band cross section. Once we reduced the dimensions using PCA, we performed K-Means on the resulting principal components. We chose three clusters to represent high, median and low density.</p>
